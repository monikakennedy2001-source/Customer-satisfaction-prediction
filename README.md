# Customer Satisfaction Prediction

## Project Description
This project predicts customer satisfaction levels for airline passengers based on demographics, travel type, service ratings, and feedback using classification models. The prediction is available via a Streamlit app.

## Skills Learned
- Python, Machine Learning (Classification)
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Streamlit App Development
- MLflow Integration

## Dataset
- Passenger_Satisfaction.csv
- Features: Gender, Customer Type, Age, Type of Travel, Class, Flight Distance, Inflight wifi service, Seat comfort, Online boarding, Check-in service, etc.

## Approach
1. Data Preprocessing & Encoding
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Classification Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
4. Model Tracking using MLflow
5. Streamlit App Development

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py`

## Project Deliverables
- Preprocessed dataset
- Classification models logged with MLflow
- Interactive Streamlit app
